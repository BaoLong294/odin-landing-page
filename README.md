# Odin Landing Page Project

## Introduction

This project is a static Landing Page developed as part of The Odin Project's Foundations Course. The primary goal of this project is to reinforce HTML knowledge for content structuring and CSS for styling and layout, with a particular focus on Flexbox.

## Initial Project Goals

- Apply and solidify HTML knowledge to structure the user interface according to the design mock-up.
- Design layout and styling using CSS, focusing on Flexbox for element alignment and arrangement.
- Understand and implement the "sticky footer" principle to ensure the footer always remains at the bottom of the viewport.
- Practice fundamental CSS properties such as colors, fonts, sizing, padding, margins, and borders.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (specifically Flexbox)
- Git
- GitHub
- VS Code

## Completed Features

- Header Section: Includes a logo and navigation links, aligned using Flexbox.
- Hero Section: Displays a main title, introductory paragraph, and a call-to-action button, along with an image placeholder.
- Information Section: Presents a title and four information cards, each with a placeholder box and a brief description, arranged and centered using Flexbox.
- Quote Section: Features an inspiring quote and its author, with the quote text styled in italic and the author aligned to the right.
- Call to Action Section: A prominent call-to-action block with text and a button, beautifully aligned using Flexbox.
- Footer: A copyright footer centered and consistently positioned at the bottom of the page through a sticky footer technique.

## Skills Demonstrated

- HTML Structure: Built a semantic and organized HTML structure for a complete landing page.
- Layout Design: Mastered the use of Flexbox to create complex layouts and align elements on the page.
- CSS Styling: Applied various CSS properties for colors, fonts, sizing, spacing, and borders to replicate the design.
- Sticky Footer Implementation: Successfully implemented the sticky footer technique to manage footer positioning.
- Resource Management: Linked external CSS files and utilized external fonts (Roboto).

## Lessons Learned

- Biggest Challenge: Mastering Flexbox properties and their interactions to achieve precise layouts according to the design was an initial challenge.
- How I Overcame It: I overcame this by practicing with various examples, reading in-depth Flexbox documentation, and experimenting with justify-content, align-items, gap, and flex properties.
- Overall Lesson: This project reinforced my understanding of the importance of breaking down projects into smaller, manageable parts and addressing them incrementally, as well as the power of Flexbox in modern layout building.
